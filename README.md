# Clojure Extensibility Points

Madison Clojure Meetup presentation on ways to extend Clojure functionality outside of the core language

To run the presentation you'll need ruby and run

`bundle install`

then

`showoff serve`

All the code in the presentation is located within the `src` directory of this repository

## Bonus Round

After going through the presentation try your hand at making a [Copy On Write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write) vector for Clojure using `deftype` and the core Clojure interfaces. The skeleton of the data type is in `src/bonkonauts/bonus.clj`
